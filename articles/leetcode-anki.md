# Leetcode Anki cards generator + python library

Hi there! I've written a script that generates Anki flashcards for all the leetcode problems.

Publishing it here in case somebody finds it useful: https://github.com/prius/leetcode-anki

I am not publishing an Anki deck itself, as I'm not sure if it is ok in terms of copyright. But I'm pretty sure it is fine to generate a deck for your personal use.

To make this possible, I've also created a python library (using swagger) to fetch all sorts of data from leetcode: https://github.com/prius/python-leetcode

So in case you want to generate your own cards or anything else, feel free to use it as well.

At this point, I'm in the active development stage, so pull requests are welcome.
