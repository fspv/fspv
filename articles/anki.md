# Anki + studying = <3

A couple of years ago, I discovered Anki. I quickly realized that this is one of the best tools you can think about for learning. It makes studying new things so easy. After those two years, I'm still using it in my day-to-day life. It is not only languages now. I am studying everything with Anki. Mostly computer science topics, of course.

I have decks for:
* English (words, grammar, idioms, phrasal verbs), German, Portuguese, Ukrainian
* Object-oriented design patterns
* Binary to decimal and Hexadecimal to binary number conversion
* Latency numbers. Like network, disk, RAM latency (useful for system design interviews)
* System design
* Algorithms theory
* Leetcode questions

The idea of Anki is pretty simple. It is based on how your brain works and optimizes the learning process to make memorizing more effective. The technique is called [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition). I won't be diving into details here but will just mention that it really works. There is a great [course on coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn), that tells more about the science behind that.

I've started with learning English words before my move to the UK. After one year of reviewing flashcards every day, I've increased my vocabulary from 6k words to 12k. This is primarily thanks to Anki. Already quite impressive, isn't it?

I've also learned about 1k German words via Anki. Just because I can. I still can't speak German, but at least I know a thousand words.

Now for languages, I'm learning Portuguese and Ukrainian. Don't ask me why, haha. Some people know, though.

After learning languages for a while, I realized I can use the same technique for learning literally anything. I was studying algorithms back then. So I started to make notes on my tablet for every topic I learn. The note later turns into a flashcard, so it should be small enough to fit the phone screen and to be repeated within 30 seconds.

Some examples of flashcards I created:

I even started to grind leetcode using Anki later. But this was not such an easy task, as I wanted to have really lovely flashcards with all the questions and the description, so I don't need to go to leetcode itself to read the description. For that, I've created a client for leetcode API https://github.com/prius/python-leetcode, which I later used to get all the problem descriptions from leetcode (the code is here https://github.com/prius/leetcode-anki). As a result, I got quite a nice Anki deck.

This deck I really like, and it really helps. You just have to adjust the frequency settings. Otherwise, you'll be getting 5 tasks a day, which is unmanageable unless you're full-time leetcode-grinder.

I tried to use Anki for some other weird things as well, like small talk ideas. But anyway, in order for that to work out, you also have to have a strong motivation to learn. Otherwise those flashcards will be left untouched and covered in dust. But motivation is the topic of another article.

It would be nice to hear how other people use it. I can pick up some ideas.
